# infinitefail2

## :orange_book: Description

I was looking to solve one of the most difficult problems I ever considered. How to create a single page application that just loops through a randomly ordered selection of pre-scraped videos of people on skateboards getting hurt. After months of research and work, I present to you: **Infinite fail v2**.

## :video_camera: Where are these videos from?

Full credit where it's due, all the videos were scraped from [@hallofmeat's](https://www.instagram.com/hallofmeat/) Instagram page about 2 years ago. Apparently Instagram have changed their API in a way that makes scraping for these video URLs A LOT more difficult, but luckily [version one of infinite fail](http://infinite-fail.herokuapp.com/) had all the URLs stashed inside the database so a quick psql export and I just threw them all into a JS file here and we're good to go!
